## Why Structure Check was added
Structure Check was added to encourage people not to cheat/use more malicious mods which have structure check or esp, which may tempt them into malicious forms of mining such as macroing or grotto esp.  
> I also made this because I did not want people to rage and then download some super suspicious mod that will get them ratted or complain about why blingbling sapphire 24 vein was getting griefed.
