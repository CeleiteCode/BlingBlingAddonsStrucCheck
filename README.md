## Introduction:
Structure Check is an **addon** for [BlingBling Addons](https://github.com/blingblingdeveloper/blingblingaddons).

<span style="color: #AA0000;">All ChatTriggers modules must comply with Hypixel rules to be verified.</span>

This feature was separated from the mod for people who do not intend to use it, and to ensure <span style="color: #FF55FF;">BlingBling Addons</span> could be verified.

## Installation:
1. Go to the [Releases]().

<h2 style="color: #00AA00;">Why Structure Check was added</h2>
Structure Check was added to encourage people not to cheat/use more malicious mods which have structure check or esp, which may tempt them into malicious forms of mining such as macroing or grotto esp.  
> I also made this because I did not want people to rage and then download some super suspicious mod that will get them ratted or complain about why blingbling sapphire 24 vein was getting griefed.
