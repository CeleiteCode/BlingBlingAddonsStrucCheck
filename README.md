## Introduction:
Structure Check is an addon for [BlingBling Addons](https://github.com/blingblingdeveloper/blingblingaddons).

$\small\color{#AA0000}{\textsf{All ChatTriggers modules must comply with Hypixel rules to be verified.}}$  
This feature was separated from the mod for people who do not intend to use it, and to ensure **BlingBling Addons** could be verified.

## Installation:
1. Go to the [Releases]().
2. Unzip the file, you should have a folder called $\small\color{#FFAA00}{\textsf{blingblingaddonsstruccheck}}$
3. Run $\small\color{#FFAA00}{\textsf{/ct files}}$ this should open the ChatTriggers folder
4. Open the $\small\color{#FFAA00}{\textsf{modules}}$ folder

This code is completely open source, however please note that it has $\small\color{#AA0000}{\textsf{not been verified}}$ by the ChatTriggers team and is $\small\color{#AA0000}{\textsf{against Hypixel rules}}$.

## Why Structure Check was added
Structure Check was added to encourage people not to cheat/use more malicious mods which have structure check or esp, which may tempt them into malicious forms of mining such as macroing or grotto esp.  
> I also made this because I did not want people to rage and then download some super suspicious mod that will get them ratted or complain about why blingbling sapphire 24 vein was getting griefed.
